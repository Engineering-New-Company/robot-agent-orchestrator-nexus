# Robot Agent - Advanced Robotics Platform

An AI-powered robotics development and deployment platform built with cutting-edge technologies for autonomous systems, computer vision, and intelligent manufacturing.

## ü§ñ Project Overview

Robot Agent provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developing, training, and deploying AI-driven robotics applications. From deep reinforcement learning to real-time computer vision, our platform accelerates robotics innovation from research to production.

### Key Features

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Advanced DRL algorithms (PPO, SAC, DDPG) for autonomous robotics agents
- **Computer Vision Pipeline**: Real-time visual processing with object detection and pose tracking
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Access to 100,000+ AI models with one-click deployment
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Seamless integration with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and robotics frameworks
- **IIoT Connectivity**: Industrial-grade C++ pipelines for real-time system integration
- **Production Deployment**: Enterprise-grade deployment with monitoring and failover systems

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
